        Termites are silent destroyers. They can cause serious damage to wooden structures before you even notice them. Here are the top 5 warning signs:
      </p>

      <ol className="list-decimal ml-6 space-y-4 text-gray-800">
        <li>
          <strong>Hollow-Sounding Wood:</strong> Tap on your wooden furniture or floors. If it sounds empty, termites may have eaten the inside.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Visible Mud Tubes:</strong> Termites build mud tunnels to travel. Look for pencil-thin trails near walls or foundations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cracks in Paint or Wood:</strong> Bubbling paint or cracked wood can be a hidden signal of internal damage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Swarmers or Discarded Wings:</strong> Flying termites indicate a growing colony. Their wings near windows are a red flag.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Damaged Books, Boxes, or Cardboard:</strong> Termites don’t just eat wood. They’ll go for paper too.
        </li>
      </ol>
